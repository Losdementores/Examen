        <p class="parrafo">
            Over the years, the Iron Man character has gone through many
            Jon Favreau's name is already immortalized on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The American actor, director, screenwriter and film producer received his star on the emblematic boulevard this Monday, in the Television category. The artist was accompanied by his friends Robert Downey Jr. and chef Roy Choi. <br>

            “Thank you all so much for coming out and welcoming me on Hollywood Boulevard. I used to live a few streets away and would walk here to see the parade at Christmas. We have so many fond memories in this theater, El Capitan, with Iron Man, the Avengers movies, the premieres of The Jungle Book, The Lion King, The Mandalorian... The honor is to be a part of all of this," Jon said in his thank you speech
          </p>
          <p class="parrafo">Actor Robert Downey Jr. wanted to support his friend and co-worker during the emotional event. “Jon firmly understands that life is fleeting; and if we are not laughing, we are dying. I think the reason why he is so competent and such a complete artist comes from his profound mastery. He is relentless in his pursuit of what is to come and what is possible," said the Iron Man star.</p>
