Since its release, Iron Man has become one of the most beloved Marvel Comics characters. Likewise, the interpretation of Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe helped a lot to further enhance the character, and gain much more recognition in other generations.

                    American comics published by Marvel Comics born in Sofia, Bulgaria.
                    The character was co-created by writer-editor Stan Lee and
                    screenwriter Larry Lieber. The artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby were in
                    charge of its design. This superhero made his first appearance in

                    Edward "Tony" Stark is a fictional character portraying this
                    character, an American billionaire business tycoon and philanthropist,
                    playboy, and resourceful scientist, who suffered a serious chest
                    injury during a kidnapping in the Middle East. When his captors try to
                    force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he crafts armor
                    instead to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops
                    his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices that he
                    designed through his company, Stark Industries. Use the suit and
                    successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at
                    first hiding his true identity, Stark eventually declared who he was
                    in a public announcement.

                    the creation of Iron Man was inspired by Cold War themes, particularly
                    the role of American technology and industry in the fight against
                    communism. Later Iron Man imaginations have moved from these motifs to
                    contemporary issues of times,3 such as terrorism, corruption and crime
                    in general. For most of the character's publication history, Iron Man
                    was a member and leader of the Avengers team, has appeared in various
                    incarnations of their various comic book series, and was also adapted
                    for various television shows and animated films.

                <p class="parrafo">Tony Stark, who was born under the name of Anthony Edward Stark and later known as Iron Man, is the son of the head of Stark Industries, Howard Stark and his wife Maria Stark. Without a doubt, Tony is a very smart little guy who enters MIT at the age of 15 to study mechanical engineering. This knowledge is then strengthened with master's degrees in electrical engineering and physics. After his parents are killed in a car accident, he goes on to inherit the company that belonged to his father.</p>
                <p class="parrafo">While observing the effects of his experimental technology on the American war effort, Tony Stark ends up being injured by a bomb and captured by Wong-Chu, who orders him to design weapons. However, Stark's injuries are severe and shrapnel is directed at his heart. From this event, Ho Yinsen, his fellow prisoner and Nobel Prize-winning physicist, builds him a magnetic chest plate to prevent shrapnel from reaching Stark's heart, thus managing to keep him alive.</p>
                <p class="parrafo">Secretly, Stark and Yinsen use the workshop to design and build a power armor, which Stark uses to escape. But unfortunately, Yinsen sacrifices himself to save his partner.Back home, Tony Stark begins to prepare to give life to Iron Man. In this way, the boy discovers that the fragment of shrapnel lodged in his chest cannot be removed without killing him, and he has no choice but to use said plate underneath. of your clothes.</p>

                <h3 class="titulo">Armor</h3>
                <p class="parrafo">Iron Man possesses a powered armor. The curious thing about this armor is that it will give you strength, superhuman durability, a wide variety of weapons and the possibility of being able to fly. The truth is that the weapon systems of the suit have changed over the years; however, Iron Man's standard offensive weapons were always repulsor beams that are fired from the palms of his gloves.</p>
                <p class="parrafo">Other weapons that were incorporated into various versions of the armor are: the single beam projector on his chest; an electromagnetic pulse generator; and a defensive energy shield that can extend up to 360 degrees. On the other hand, in addition to the general-purpose model that Iron Man wears, Stark also developed various specialized suits for space travel, deep-sea diving, and other special purposes.</p>

                <p class="parrafo">There is no doubt that Tony Stark is a genius who has a lot of experience in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, and computer science. A not minor detail is that the experience in electrical engineering and mechanical engineering that the character possesses manages to surpass Reed Richards, Hank Pym and Bruce Banner.</p>
                <p class="parrafo">Por otra parte, Iron Man es considerado uno de los personajes mÃ¡s inteligentes que tiene Marvel. Dicho esto, cabe resaltar que Tony Stark se graduÃ³ con tÃ­tulos avanzados en fÃ­sica e ingenierÃ­a a la edad de 17 aÃ±os en el Instituto de TecnologÃ­a de Massachusetts (MIT). Su experiencia se extiende a su ingenio para enfrentar situaciones difÃ­ciles, donde logra utilizar las herramientas disponibles, incluido su traje, de manera poco ortodoxa pero sumamente efectiva.</p>
